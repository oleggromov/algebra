# Summary of 3rd to 1st lessons

## Real numbers
There're different kinds of numbers combined in *sets* with *subsets*.
The first one is *Rational numbers*, which consists in turn of:

- *rational numbers* (`0.33` for instance) those can be represented in a form of fraction (`1/3`)
- *integer numbers* (`{-Infinity, .., Infinity}`) those can be diveded without a reminder by 1
- *whole numbers* those include zero and other positive integers
- *natural numbers* (`{1, 2, ..}`) used mainly for counting

*Irrational numbers* set doesn't intersect with rational one because any of them:

- cannot be written as a ratio of integers (fraction)
- doesn't have terminating or infinitely repeating pattern of decimals (like `0.33` has)

Famous irrational numbers are pi (`3.14159..`) or e (`2.71828..`) for instance.

Both sets form a big set of *Real numbers*.

## Expression simplification

In order to evaluate any expression it should be simplified as much as possible first. Algorithm looks as follows:

- simplify each term (bunch of variables or numbers that are multiplied together)
- combine like terms

Example polynomial expression is: `3 × y² × x × 2 + 24y² - y²x`.

### Simplifying terms
For instance, `3 × y² × x × 2` (the first term of the above expression) should be written in traditional and conventional form `6y²x` where coefficient (constant factor) is placed in front of the whole term combined with another coefficients (`2 × 3`) followed by variables ordered from the highest to the lowest degree (exponent value).

### Combining like terms
Further simplification is possible by means of *like terms combining*. Like terms are those who have:

- exactly the same variables
- with the same powers

In above example there're only two like terms which becomes obvious after the first term was simplified.
They are `6y²x` and `—y²x`.

As the variables are the same (both `y` and `x`) and their powers concur (`y²` and `x¹`), those terms can be combined into one: `5y²x`.

> Be aware of **signs** besides terms! The sign error is the most widespread error in expression simplification process.

The result of this *expression simplification* looks way more simplier: `24y² + 5y²x`.

## Arithmetic operations properties

**Commutativity** means that the order of operands doesn't matter: `a + b = b + a` or `a × b = b × a`. In arithmetics, both *addition* and *multiplication* are commutative.

*Subtraction* is not commutative: `1 - 2 ≠ 2 - 1` but instead `1 - 2 = -2 + 1`
*Division* is not commutative too: `2 / 4 ≠ 4 / 2`.

**Distributivity** of operation means that in order to complete it the operation should be distributed over another one. Multiplication is distributive over addition and subtraction (which is a shortcut for addition with term multiplied by `-1`, e.g. `1 - 3 = 1 + (3 × -1)`). For example, `4 × (2 + 3) = 4 × 2 + 4 × 3`. Distribution over means that the operation is applied to every term in parenthesis.

Division is not distributive because `4 / (3 + 2) ≠ 4 / 3 + 4 / 2`, because `4 / (3 + 2)` equals to `4 / 5` while `4 / 3 + 4 / 2` evaluates to `3.(33)`.

### Shortucts

Very interesting that *multiplication is just a handy shortcut for addition*: `2 × 3 = 2 + 2 + 2`, i.e. to multiply 2 by 3 means to repeat addition thrice.

In turn, *exponentiation is just a handy one for multiplication*: `2³ = 2 × 2 × 2`, i.e. two for the third equals to multiply three twos.

## Substitution

The final step of evaluating an expression is variable substitution for numbers. For example, `2x³ - 4y` for `x = -2, y = 3` should be computed as follows:

- `2 × (-2)³ - 4 × 3`
- `2 × -8 - 4 × 3`
- `-16 - 12`
- equals to `-28`

The operations succession should be kept to make evaluation and substitution correct:

1. **P**arenthesis
1. **E**xponentiation
1. **M**ultiplication
1. **D**ivision
1. **A**ddition
1. **S**ubtraction
