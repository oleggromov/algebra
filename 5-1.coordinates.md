# Coordinates

Graphing (functions, those are `y = f(x)`, where `y` represent a value on the vertical axis and x represents a value on the horizontal one) is useful to understand relationships between data and equation.

Points (values of `x` and `y` respectively) are often written as coordinate pairs in format of `(x, y)`. Traditionally the first value written in parenthesis corresponds to the value on horizontal axis.

Line plotted in the graph can be useful for data extrapolation.

### Equations with 2 variables can

- describe mathematical relationship between two variables (`y = 2x`)
- show output for given input (`y = x/2`, which is `4` when `x = 8`)
- show changing of one quantity while another changes too
- demonstrate cause and effect

### Graph plain, the Origin

The origin on the *coordinate plane* is a point `(0, 0)` from which any counting starts.

Every coordinate has an unique position on the coordinate plane and vice versa.

**Both axes** extend infinitely to the both directions.

**Bounds** for axes are written in square parenthesis (`[-5, -5]`). Those values show what size of each axis is needed to draw all points.

### The meaning of variables

Any equation can have a real-world meaning that imposes additional constraints on the possible variable values.

Mathematically speaking, a simple equation `y = 7 + 0.5x` allows `x` to become any possible real number. But if we set the special meaning for variables by applying this equation to the real-world problem that should be solved the constraints can change. For example, if we say that `y` indicates total suitcase weight, `7` stands for an empty suitcase weight (which cannot be ignored if you want to calculate the total weight), and `0.5` represents weight of one pair of glass wipers, and `x` - the number of glasses in the suitcase we can determine that `x` cannot be only a whole number until the wiper set can be broken into parts. We can also run into a problem clause making the absense of glass wipers meaningless.

Thus, taking into account all these considerations, we can say that y will always be greater or equal 7.

### Graphing process

1. get an equation
1. make table of values for x values that make sense
1. make a graph using those values

It may be useful to scale one or both axes to make graphing easier and more handy.

### Line

Minimal number of points to draw a straight line is `2`. But it is something useful to have 3 points to make sure the graph is correct.
